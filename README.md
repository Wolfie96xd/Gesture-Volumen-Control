# Gesture-Volumen-Control
This is my first publication of a software made by me. It is mainly a way to control the volume of your device through manual gestures. At the moment it is somewhat rudimentary and I hope to be able to update it with better features.   You could say that it is my first contact with the world of computer vision.
